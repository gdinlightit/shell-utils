### 3. `file-organizer.sh` - File Organization Script

```

The script will:

2. Validate all inputs and file existence
3. Create the target directory if needed
4. Move matching files
5. Clean up empty directories if no files were moved

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to the shell utilities directory:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc

source "${HOME}/shell-utils/work.sh"
source "${HOME}/shell-utils/sail.sh"
source "${HOME}/shell-utils/file-organizer.sh"
```

4. Create the logs directory:
